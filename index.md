CRAWL, WALK, RUN ...

I've always been fascinated with technology. I mean, when I hear stories about the struggles of days that my parents had to live through, I am extremely grateful and humbled. I want to leave this place a better world to live in and I know for a fact that technology will be a key factor in helping me to do so. At the same time, I am also aware of the adverse effects of overuse of anything and hence I try to balance it all out.

David Heinemeier Hansson, the creator Ruby on Rails web development framework, couldn‚Äôt have been more right when he said, ‚ÄúThe best way to predict the future is to implement it.‚Äù Nothing could be a better explanation to the immensely dynamic nature of Computer Science today. Working in the IT industry for over three and a half years, I have seen how technology is being used to drive businesses, deliver more value to customers, and stay stronger in the competitive market.  

I was always fascinated with technology, which is why I decided to pursue my Bachelor of Technology from B.V.R.I.T Narsapur. I wanted to explore right from the start, and I began my coding journey from my first year, with the help of Dr. Madhu Babu (who is also the HOD of the Computer Science Department). I made my fundamentals stronger in my second year and knew for a fact that coding was going to become an integral part of my life. My first research experience came when I got the opportunity to work on a paper titled ‚ÄúA brief review on Detection of Duplicate Defect Reports Using Natural Language Processing‚Äù (ISBN 978-93-85100-64-2) in the 3rd year of college. I worked alongside Professor Deepthi, who had introduced me to Computer Networks, Cloud Computing and NLP by then.


My interest in these areas further piqued in the fourth year, and I decided to go ahead and do internships to make my base stronger and see how I could solve real world problems. The first internship I did was in a start-up called ‚ÄúGoLive Gaming Solutions Pvt Ltd‚Äù which was a part of T-Hub in IIIT Hyderabad. I did this internship for 4 months, and in this tenure, I worked on developing a war MMO called ‚ÄúBlueDust‚Äù. The best part about this was that I worked on the implementation of not only the frontend UI of the game, but also the backend control passing between different components of the game. I saw how small things like scores are stored in between sessions and on the cloud. I basically understood very early on that Cloud was here to stay.


But soon this internship had come to an end and I wanted to further gain some exposure in the aforementioned areas. I was in my 4th year, 2nd semester by then. It was placement season, when Servicenow came to the campus. After the written test and a round of interviews, I got Servicenow and was placed into the Global Cloud Services team. This was nothing sort of a lottery for me, as I got to work in the areas that I was always attracted to. I was introduced to the Datacenter architecture for the first time and began learning.

Today, after all this time with the team, I can proudly say that I‚Äôve been very fortunate to work and learn on things like Discovery, cloning a datacenter environment, coding on the cloud and so much more. I look to further enhance my knowledge, acumen and understanding of computers and I am confident that I possess the requisite intellectual ability, motivation and the preparation in order to fulfil my objective of scientific research and the attainment of intellectual 
satisfaction.

I've decided to start this page, so that I can keep it updated with all the things I learn, make and try my hand at. I'm extremely grateful to my mentors, most importantly, Satish Anumalasetty. The depth of his wisdom and knowledge never fails to motivate me. This page is also an idea of his and I hope I can keep it updated all the time.

Coming to the title, I'd just like to say that, I'm probably in the walk phase of my journey. I crawled my way through college and these starting years of my career. I have so much to learn, and such excitement to run, I can't wait to get to it. Without further ado, welcome to my virtual world, dear reader. Hope I don't disappoint you and myself in this long journey. Sit back and as I like to say in gaming terms "GLHF : Good luck and have fun"! üòÉ
